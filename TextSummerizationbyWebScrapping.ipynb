“turing test” specifies that computers need to complete reasoning puzzles as well as humans in order to be considered “thinking” in an autonomous manner.turing was followed up a few years later by john mccarthy, who first used the term “artificial intelligence” to denote machines that could think autonomously.', 'he described the threshold as “getting a computer to do things which, when done by people, are said to involve intelligence.”since the 1950s, scientists have argued over what constitutes “thinking” and “intelligence,” and what is “fully autonomous” when it comes to hardware and software.', 'advanced computers such as the ibm watson already have beaten humans at chess and are capable of instantly processing enormous amounts of information.the lack of clarity around the term enables technology pessimists to warn ai will conquer humans, suppress individual freedom, and destroy personal privacy through a digital “1984.”today, ai generally is thought to refer to “machines that respond to stimulation consistent with traditional responses from humans, given the human capacity for contemplation, judgment, and intention.” according to researchers shubhendu and vijay, these software systems “make decisions which normally require [a] human level of expertise” and help people anticipate problems or deal with issues as they come up.', 'as argued by john allen and myself in

real-time data.', 'they are unlike passive machines that are capable only of mechanical or predetermined responses.', 'using sensors, digital data, or remote inputs, they combine information from a variety of different sources, analyze the material instantly, and act on the insights derived from those data.', 'as such, they are designed by humans with intentionality and reach conclusions based on their instant analysis.an example from the transportation industry shows how this happens.', 'autonomous vehicles are equipped with lidars (light detection and ranging) and remote sensors that gather information from the vehicle’s surroundings.', 'the lidar uses light from a radar to see objects in front of and around the vehicle and make instantaneous decisions regarding the presence of objects, distances, and whether the car is about to hit something.', 'on-board computers combine this information with sensor data to determine whether there are any dangerous conditions, the vehicle needs to shift lanes, or it should slow or stop completely.', 'all of that material has to be analyzed instantly to avoid crashes and keep the vehicle in the proper lane.with massive improvements in storage systems, processing speeds, and analytic techniques, these algorithms are capable of tremendous sophistication in analysis and decisionmaking.', 'financial algorithms can spot minute differentials in stock valuations and undertake market transactions that take advantage of that information.', 'the same logic applies in environmental sustainability systems that use sensors to determine whether someone is in a room and automatically adjusts heating, cooling, and lighting based on that information.', 'the goal is to conserve energy and use resources in an optimal manner.as

augment humans or help them perform at a higher level.', 'however, if the software is poorly designed or based on incomplete or biased information, it can endanger humanity or replicate past injustices.ai often is undertaken in conjunction with machine learning and data analytics, and the resulting combination enables intelligent decisionmaking.', 'machine learning takes data and looks for underlying trends.', 'if it spots something that is relevant for a practical problem, software designers can take that knowledge and use it with data analytics to understand specific issues.for example, there are ai systems for managing school enrollments.', 'they compile information on neighborhood location, desired schools, substantive interests, and the like, and assign pupils to particular schools based on that material.', 'as long as there is little contentiousness or disagreement regarding basic criteria, these systems work intelligently and effectively.figuring out how to

administrators fight over the importance of different factors.', 'should students always be assigned to their neighborhood school or should other criteria override that consideration?', 'as an illustration, in a city with widespread racial segregation and economic inequalities by neighborhood, elevating neighborhood school assignments can exacerbate inequality and racial segregation.', 'for these reasons, software designers have to balance competing interests and reach intelligent decisions that reflect values important in that particular community.making these kinds of decisions increasingly falls to computer programmers.', 'they must build intelligent algorithms that compile decisions based on a number of different considerations.', 'that can include basic principles such as

ethical values in algorithms to make sure they correspond to human concerns and learn and adapt in ways that are consistent with community values.', 'this is the reason it is important to ensure that ai ethics are taken seriously and permeate societal decisions.', 'in order to maximize positive outcomes, organizations should hire ethicists who work with corporate decisionmakers and software

how various coding decisions have been made, implement ai training programs so staff operationalizes ethical considerations in their daily work, and provide a means for remediation when ai solutions inflict harm or damages on people or organizations.through these kinds of safeguards, societies will increase the odds that ai systems are intentional, intelligent, and adaptable while still

ai generally is thought to refer to “machines that respond to stimulation consistent with traditional responses from humans, given the human capacity for contemplation, judgment, and intention.” according to researchers shubhendu and vijay, these software systems “make decisions which normally require [a] human level of expertise” and help people anticipate problems or deal with issues as they come up.\n","failure to do that leads to ai algorithms that are unfair and unjust.the last quality that marks ai systems is the ability to learn and adapt as they compile information and make decisions.\n","but without adequate safeguards or the incorporation of ethical considerations, the ai utopia can quickly turn into dystopia.artificial intelligence algorithms are designed to make decisions, often using real-time data.\n","as long as there is little contentiousness or disagreement regarding basic criteria, these systems work intelligently and effectively.figuring out how to reconcile conflicting values is one of the most important challenges facing ai designers.\n","however, if the software is poorly designed or based on incomplete or biased information, it can endanger humanity or replicate past injustices.ai often is undertaken in conjunction with machine learning and data analytics, and the resulting combination enables intelligent decisionmaking.\n","they must build intelligent algorithms that compile decisions based on a number of different considerations.\n","building adaptable systems that learn as they go has the potential of improving effectiveness and efficiency.\n","for these reasons, software designers have to balance competing interests and reach intelligent decisions that reflect values important in that particular community.making these kinds of decisions increasingly falls to computer programmers.\n","but making sure they “learn” in ways that are fair and just is a high priority for system designers.in short, there have been extraordinary advances in recent years in the ability of ai systems to incorporate intentionality, intelligence, and adaptability in their algorithms.\n","effective artificial intelligence must adjust as circumstances or conditions shift.\n","in order to maximize positive outcomes, organizations should hire ethicists who work with corporate decisionmakers and software developers, have a code of ai ethics that lays out how various issues will be handled, organize an ai review board that regularly addresses corporate ethical questions, have ai audit trails that show how various coding decisions have been made, implement ai training programs so staff operationalizes ethical considerations in their daily work, and provide a means for remediation when ai solutions inflict harm or damages on people or organizations.through these kinds of safeguards, societies will increase the odds that ai systems are intentional, intelligent, and adaptable while still conforming to basic human values.\n","without any human intervention, a digital assistant can make appointments, adjust schedules, and communicate those preferences to other individuals.\n"]}],"source":["import numpy as
